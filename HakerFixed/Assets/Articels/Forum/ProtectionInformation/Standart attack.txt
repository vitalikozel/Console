Author: Clown | Attacks - what are they and how to avoid them

Hello. I'll try to be brief, basically attacks will be made on you with what periodicity no one knows.
But you have to be ready anyway. Unfortunately, the corporation that developed these terminals didn't care too much about security.
So if you're new, you should have the default user shell installed, which unfortunately doesn't give you access to advanced security features.
But it is very easy to use.

In general, you have to click on the drop-down exclamation marks. There are several types of them.
And you have to click on some before they turn red. And some will wait until they are fully recharged.

In general, the topic is quite simple, you have to figure it out yourself. But if you want to practice your attack then chant the command: <color=#3A77FE>pt</color>
