In this article I will tell you how to use chrome with the help of this you can find tasks for breaking and also use the necessary programs such as for example iplogger. 

Chrome has a built-in spending plugin that can be used to earn extra income, experience, and status.

Called with the <color=#C19B00>.work.contracts</color> command, it will show you the available contracts with brief information about them. If you want to take some kind of contract, then enter the command <color=#C19B00>.work.contract id -take</color> (an example of what the .work.3123 -take command might look like).

Next, you will be shown basic information about the contract and you will be able to fulfill it; in some cases, additional information about the task will be provided (for example, the ip address of the victim).

If you don't know what to do or didn't have time to read the task, enter the command <color=#C19B00>.work.contract -v</color> and it will display all the necessary information about the contract.

Also, when you have already completed the task and disconnected from the machine (for more information, type <color=#C19B00>.forum.break connection</color>), you will have to return to chrome and write the command [. work.contract id -fin</color> (an example of what the .work.3123 -fin command might look like).

After that, you will automatically be given a reward. But if you complete the task incorrectly or do something wrong, you will be given a fine (in some contracts it is prescribed, and in some not), but the standard one is simply to deprive you of your reputation. Well, I guess that's all the information you might need to get started.
Also, the plugin automatically scans your connected machines, so before checking the completed task, I advise you to disable them.

Next, I would advise you to study the program: <color=green>wpopu.ru</color>

I also advise you to read the article about money:
