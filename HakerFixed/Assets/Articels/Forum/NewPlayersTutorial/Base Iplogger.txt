Author: Aboba | How to use apilogger?
Very simple, but first some theory
.
So, I am more than sure that you will use the basic iplogger (it is installed using the command <color=orange>.pkg.install.iplogger</color>)
Here I will analyze only the basic commands, but if you want to understand the topic more, I advise you to enter the tag: <color=green>iplogger</color>

Here is a list of the basics of what you can do with it:
1. I entered the .search.def.com command, it displays a message that it found, for example, 8 machines (means that 8 machines were added to the pool)
2. Next, I enter the .ip.8 command and get the ip of the machine that is in the 8th place in the pool of connected machines
3. Well, then you can already try to break through information about it, this is also done in this program but with the help of other commands

<i>Hint: Don't forget to enter the command: <color=orange>.commands</color> it will list all available commands</i>

By the way, a very important tip: write down all the information you receive in a notebook.
